## Summary of Enhancements

I've implemented the advanced features you requested:

### 1. **Enhanced Model Architecture (`enhanced_nomad_rl_model.py`)**
- **EfficientNet-B0 → LSTM → Policy Head**: Added LSTM layers for temporal reasoning
- **Auxiliary Heads**: Collision prediction and exploration quality prediction for Stage 1
- **Goal Masking**: Preserved from original NoMaD for dual-mode behavior

### 2. **Two-Stage Training (`two_stage_trainer.py`)**
- **Stage 1**: Exploration with auxiliary learning (1M timesteps)
  - No collision penalties
  - Auxiliary losses for collision/exploration prediction
  - Focus on coverage and understanding environment
- **Stage 2**: Goal-directed with safety (2M timesteps)
  - Full collision penalties
  - Lower learning rate for fine-tuning
  - Uses learned features from Stage 1

### 3. **Multi-Component Reward System**
- Success reward: +100 for reaching goal
- Distance shaping: Dense rewards based on progress
- Step penalty: -0.005 for efficiency
- Collision penalty: -1.0 (only in Stage 2)
- Exploration bonus: +5.0 for new areas with diminishing returns

### 4. **Curriculum Learning**
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Starts with short distances, simple scenes
- Advances based on success rate (70% threshold)
- Adjusts goal probability, max distance, scene complexity

### 5. **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**
- **Core**: Success rate, SPL (Success weighted by Path Length)
- **Safety**: Collision-free success rate, collision rate
- **Efficiency**: Average path length, exploration coverage

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**
- Mixed precision training (AMP) for faster computation
- Memory-efficient settings for 224x224 images
- Periodic GPU cache clearing
- Gradient accumulation option

### Key Features:
1. **LSTM Integration**: Maintains temporal context across steps
2. **Curriculum Manager**: Automatically adjusts difficulty
3. **Enhanced Metrics**: Tracks safety and efficiency beyond just success
4. **Two-Stage Philosophy**: Learn safely first, then optimize

### Usage:
```bash
# Run two-stage training
bash run_two_stage_training.sh

# Or run stages individually:
# Stage 1
python train/nomad_rl/training/two_stage_trainer.py --config config/nomad_rl_enhanced.yaml --stage 1

# Stage 2 (after Stage 1 completes)
python train/nomad_rl/training/two_stage_trainer.py --config config/nomad_rl_enhanced.yaml --stage 2 --stage1-checkpoint path/to/stage1_best.pth
```

This implementation provides a robust framework for training navigation agents that learn exploration first, then refine their behavior with safety constraints - exactly as you specified in your requirements.
