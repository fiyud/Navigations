## Summary

I've created a comprehensive solution for using both iTHOR and RoboTHOR datasets together:

### 1. **Combined Dataset Splitter (`combined_dataset_splits.py`)**
- Splits iTHOR with 80/10/10 ratio across all room types
- Preserves official RoboTHOR splits (60/15/14)
- Creates combined splits with both datasets:
  - **Train**: ~96 iTHOR + 60 RoboTHOR = ~156 scenes
  - **Val**: ~12 iTHOR + 15 RoboTHOR = ~27 scenes  
  - **Test**: ~12 iTHOR + 14 RoboTHOR = ~26 scenes

### 2. **Enhanced Environment (`enhanced_ai2thor_env.py`)**
- Automatically detects scene type (iTHOR vs RoboTHOR)
- Switches controller settings appropriately
- Handles different navigation characteristics of each dataset

### 3. **Updated Training Pipeline**
- Supports `--dataset combined` option
- Loads appropriate splits based on dataset choice
- Single command execution for combined dataset

### Usage:

```bash
# Generate combined dataset splits
python train/nomad_rl/combined_dataset_splits.py

# Train on combined dataset - Stage 1
./run_experiments.sh -d combined -s 1

# Train on combined dataset - Stage 2
./run_experiments.sh -d combined -s 2 -c checkpoints/unified/combined_stage1_best.pth

# Run complete pipeline on combined dataset
./run_complete_pipeline.sh combined

# Run on all datasets (iTHOR, RoboTHOR, and combined)
./run_complete_pipeline.sh all
```

### Key Features:

1. **Balanced Representation**: Each split maintains diversity with both indoor navigation (iTHOR) and apartment navigation (RoboTHOR) scenarios

2. **No Data Leakage**: Train/val/test splits are completely separate with no overlap

3. **Preserved Characteristics**:
   - iTHOR: Balanced room types (kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom)
   - RoboTHOR: Official splits for fair comparison with other methods

4. **Seamless Integration**: The combined dataset works with the same training pipeline - just use `-d combined`

5. **Enhanced Robustness**: Training on both datasets should create more robust navigation policies that generalize better

The combined dataset provides approximately 209 unique scenes for training and evaluation, giving your model exposure to both structured indoor environments (iTHOR) and more complex apartment layouts (RoboTHOR).
